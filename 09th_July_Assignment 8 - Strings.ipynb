    "Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.\n",

    "Explanation: Deleting \"s\" from \"sea\" adds the ASCII value of \"s\" (115) to the sum.\n",

    "After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: chars = [\"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"c\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [\"a\",\"2\",\"b\",\"2\",\"c\",\"3\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The groups are \"aa\", \"bb\", and \"ccc\". This compresses to \"a2b2c3\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:-  Intuition\n",
    "The problem asks for compressing an array of characters using a specific algorithm. The goal is to modify the array in-place and return the new length of the compressed array. To achieve this, we need to iterate through the array and handle consecutive groups of repeating characters according to the given rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "The provided solution uses a two-pointer approach to traverse the array. The i pointer keeps track of the current character being examined, while the count variable counts the consecutive occurrences of the character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by initializing i and count to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until i reaches the second-to-last index of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the loop, the algorithm checks if the next character (chars[i+1]) is equal to the current character (chars[i]). If they are the same, it means we have a consecutive group of repeating characters. In this case, the algorithm removes the next character using chars.pop(i+1) and increments the count variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the characters are not the same, the algorithm checks if the count variable is greater than 1. This indicates that we have a group of repeating characters to compress. In this case, the algorithm converts the count into a list of individual digits using [*str(count)]. It then iterates over this list, inserts each digit into the chars array, and increments i accordingly. This step ensures that groups with lengths of 10 or more are properly split into multiple characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the count is not greater than 1, it means we have a single occurrence of a character, so the algorithm moves to the next character by incrementing i.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the while loop, the algorithm checks if there is a remaining group of repeating characters that have not been compressed. If count is greater than 1, the algorithm converts it into a list of digits and appends each digit to the chars array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the algorithm returns the length of the modified chars array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity:\n",
    "The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input chars array. The algorithm iterates through the array once, performing constant-time operations at each step.\n",
